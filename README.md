# Introduce

IP2Country is a tool convert ipaddress to country code. 
The idea is from other private repository and thanks the author
Now I rewrite it with golang to public. 
And I will add more functions and fix code in further when I am free


## Usage

```
    $ ip2country update
    $ ip2country search 196.223.39.2
      GA
 
```   
## Todo
    1. support IPV6    x
    2. optimization code (sqlite3 to store ip data) √
       2.1 update is too slow, need to optimize   x
    3. add build scripts and deployment (dockerfile) √
    4. add ipaddress Judgement (regexp) √
